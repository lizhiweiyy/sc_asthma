# Analysis of  Single cell RNA-seq data in mouse allergic asthma

This project creates a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of mouse lung in Ovalbumin(OVA) induced chronic asthma model. This project aims to reveal asthma-related cell subpopulations and the cell type-specific transcriptional changes of lung tissues in allergic asthma.
